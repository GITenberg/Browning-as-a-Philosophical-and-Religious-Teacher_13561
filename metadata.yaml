description: Robert Browning (1812-1889) was indubitably one of the great poets of
  the Victorian era. But this book looks beyond the words. The purpose of this book
  is to deal with Browning, not simply as a poet, but rather as the exponent of a
  system of ideas on moral and religious subjects, which may fairly be called philosophy.
  More than mere aesthetics, his works are reflections of his contemplations of religion
  and morality.
